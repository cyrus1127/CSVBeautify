# CSVBeautify
 A Google chorme extension plugin

What dose it do? 
 It can help user beautify the cvs data in a Json style.
 Cause brownser cant seperate and the value by key with tab in raw data.
 
 This tools can help you.
 
 Have any Limitation ? 
 Yes, i found there have some problems. 
 Some of the format cant splite very well.
 The seperator can't define the rich content like description with "," char value.
 That will make the result broken as logic encountered overflow exceptions.
 
 And also i have targeted the custom domain name. 
 Because this is one of the favorite part , which can make convenient for work.
